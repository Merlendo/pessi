# Pessi Game

A simple game using the Pygame library where the player controls a character named "pessi" to prevent a ball from falling off the screen. The goal is to keep the ball in the air for as long as possible by colliding it with the pessi.
I developed this game to learn the basic of the pygame library.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## How to Play

1. Ensure you have at least Python 3.10 installed on your system.
2. Install the Pygame library by running: `pip install pygame`
3. Download the game files, including images (pessi.ico, grass_50.jpg, pessi.png, and ball.png).
4. Run the game script using: `python game.py`

## Controls

- Use the Left and Right arrow keys to move the pessi character horizontally.
- Press Enter to restart the game when it's over.

## Game Mechanics

- The ball falls from the top of the screen, and the player must prevent it from reaching the bottom.
- Colliding the ball with the pessi increases the score.
- The game ends when the ball falls off the screen.

## File Descriptions
